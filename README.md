This is a Team Management System project where I have-
1. Designed and implemented a team management system using Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles.
2. Enabled users to create, store, and manage team information including batsmen, bowlers, wicket keepers, and more. Developed interactive console-based interface to input and display team details.
3. Utilized encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure clean and extensible code design.
4. Enhanced understanding of OOPs concepts and Java programming techniques.
